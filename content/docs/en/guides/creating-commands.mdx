Creating a command is easy. You need to extend the `CommandBase` class.

```java
public class ExampleCommand extends CommandBase {

    public ExampleCommand() {
        super("example", "A example command", false);
    }

    @Override
    protected void executeSync(@Nonnull CommandContext context) {
        context.sendMessage(Message.raw("Hello from ExampleCommand!"));
    }
}
```
